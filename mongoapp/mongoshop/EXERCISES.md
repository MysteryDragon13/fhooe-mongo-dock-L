## Install Docker and create a MongoDB Atlas Account

Install docker containers for MongoDB and the Mongo-Express Webinterface. See [Get Github-Repo](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/INSTALL.md#get-repo) and [Docker INSTALL](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/INSTALL.md#docker) for that.

Create a cloud account for MongoDB Atlas. See [Cloud INSTALL](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/INSTALL.md#cloud) for that.
Make yourself familiar with MongoDB Atlas, especially with `Database`, `Atlas Search`, `Browse Collections`. Look around and **don't accidentially delete data**, you will need later on. 
Have a look at the data sets with MongoDB Charts.
- Go to MongoDB Charts.
- Add the Data Source shipwrecks.
- Add geospatial heatmap Chart based on coordinates and feature_type to your Dashboard.
- Zoom in.
- Play with other datasets and possibilities.
- Upload this and two additional charts as screenshots in fullscreen mode to Moodle. The data sets and the chart types have to be different.

## Working with Documents

- Connect to MongoDB Atlas.
- Click `Database` and then `Browse Collections`.

Never use capped collections or time series.
See [Blog Example](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/src/Examples/document/blog.js) for a first full example for embedding and using arrays and subcollections (Objects)

- Click `Create Database` and add database `onlineshop` and a first collection `user`.
- To add more collections hover over database `onlineshop` and click the plus sign next to it.
- Click on `INSERT DOCUMENT` to add documents to a collection.
- Add user with optional phone numbers, product with optional description, orders with billing address, delivery address, order_items and payment_details to the data model.
- Do not add the ObjectId explicitly, that is done implicitly by MongoDB.

Change the ER data model of [onlineshop](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-web-dock/blob/main/src/onlineshop.sql) to a document based model.
Consider to use sub-documents, where they are useful. Use Arrays, if they are the better choice.
Add more indexes to collection product for keys that are relevant for queries. Add a fulltext index to collection product.

!! Use `"date_registered": { "$toDate": "2014-07-08T10:43:33.522Z" }` dates if you use JSON-Editor `{}`.

!! Use data type `Object` for sub-documents.

Create a file with an appropriate name and the extension .js. Copy your JSON from MongoDB-Atlas to it and modify it in the specified way.
See the [example ue2.js](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/src/Examples/document/ue2.js)  to get the format for the upload to Moodle.

## Fulltext Search with MongoDB Atlas

See [MongoDB Atlas Search Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/) to see the whole documentation.

Have a look at the MongoDB Atlas Search Example [Restaurant Page](https://www.atlassearchrestaurants.com/) and
the accompaning [Explain Video](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/atlas-search-demo-restaurant-app/)
Work with the [MongoDB Atlas Search Tester UI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/search-ui/#std-label-atlas-search-query-ui)

Copy commands you write to a file with an appropriate name and extension .js to upload it in Moodle.
Write comment lines with `//` and number the examples (`// Fulltext Search with MongoDB Atlas` and so on) or use the comments to document what the query is about.
Use the Visual Editor for your first attempts and the JSON Editor to adapt the examples. 

### Working with the mflix-dataset

- Create another index on mflix-movies with an appropriate name.

Do not use a mapping with `"dynamic": true` as shown below, but specify the columns `plot`, `genres`,  `title`, `fullplot` and `directors` explicitly.
Here you can find more about [defining field mappings](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/define-field-mappings/).
You can find examples [HERE](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/define-field-mappings/#std-label-index-config-example).
```
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true
  }
}
```
- Copy the query (with a comment as headline `// Working with the mflix-dataset`) to your .js file.

### Working with the shipwrecks dataset

See [GeoPoint Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/near/#std-label-near-ref) for more information.
Maybe review the documentation for defining field mappings again.

- Change one entry of shipwrecks and change it in a way, that geo queries are possible on an Object `location`.
- Use the existing array `coordinates` and surround it with a `location` `Object` that contains `type: "Point"` and the array `coordinates: [ ... , ... ]`.
- Then convert 4 more documents in the same way.
- Copy one of these documents to your .js file.
- Create a search index on shipwrecks in sample_geospatial with the button "Search Indexes" on the most right tab.
- Click the "Create Index" button and use either the visual editor or the JSON-Editor to do so.
- Define an index containing the fields location of type geo, feature_type and watlev of type string.
- Copy the index definition to your .js file.
- To start a query press the button "Query" in the list of "Search Indexes"
- Type **visible** into the search field.
- Press the Search button.
- Press "Edit Query Syntax"
- Copy the original query to your .js file.
- Edit the query in a way, that the search is done for documents containing **visible** **AND/OR** **submerged**
- Copy the new query to your .js file.
- Write a geo search query based on this index with `"next"` on `"path": "location"` and further required keys.
- Copy query to your .js file.

A documentation for all geospatial queries you can find [HERE](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/)
Build more examples according to the [Search Tutorials](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/tutorials/) for additional points.

### Working with Schema Validation in MongoDB

In certain collections we'd like to have required columns. 
For example a product should have a name, a price, a sku and some more fields that all documents have in common.

To bring a partial schema and central input validation (constraints) to mongodb documents you can use [Schema Validation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/).

- Start Docker Desktop.
- Open Powershell or other terminal.
- Connect to mongodb client
```
docker exec -it mongodb /bin/bash -c mongosh
```
## Useful statements
- `use test;` if you are not already in this database
- `show collections;` to see, if any collection is already stored.
- `db.getCollectionInfos( { name: "students" } )[0].options.validator` to see the validation rules for already existing collections.
## Exercise
- Document each statement with its response to a file with extension .json or .js or .txt.
- Submit the provided `students` [example](https://github.com/Digital-Media/mongoshop/blob/main/src/Examples/SchemaValidation/students.md)
- it's based on a MongoDB example in the [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json).
- Insert 2 documents into `students`.
- Find out, how to insert integer values and doubles.
- 1st document without key street
- 2nd document with key street. 
- Insert documents, that cause validation errors for required major, year not in valid range and gpa is not a double and document them with further inserts.

- Create a schema validation for a table `product` with required keys `"name": string`, `"price": double`, `"sku": int` and `"active": bool`.
- Insert 3 documents.
- With all 3 inserts use 2 additional keys that are not required and validated (in this case you need not mention them in the validator).
- Insert a document, that causes an error on the boolean data type of active.

### Working with Aggregation Pipeline and the sample.supplies.sales data set

See [MongoDB Aggregation Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/) for more Information.

**1. Example**
- Connect to MongoDB Atlas
- Use Collection sample_supplies.sales
- Go to Aggregation Tab
- Add $match stage to reduce the documents to storeLocation = "New York"
- Add a $count stage to find out how many stores are in New York.
- Store the result in a collection with a $out stage.
- Export pipeline to Phyton Language and include import statements and driver syntax.
- Copy result to a file with an appropriate name and extension .js.

**2. Example**
- Use Collection sample_supplies.sales again
- Go to Aggregation Tab
- Add $match stage to reduce the documents to storeLocation = "New York"
- Add a $unwind stage to unwind items for a $group stage
- Add a group stage and build sum of the multiply of items.price and items.quantity grouped by items.name
- Store the result in a collection with a $out stage.
- Export pipeline code to Phyton Language and include import statements and driver syntax.
- Append the copied result to the file created above.
- Upload file to Moodle.

**3. For additional 4 points for HYP3VO (optional)**
- Go to the sample_restaurants.restaurants data set
- Group the result bei borough and count the number of restaurants:
- Reduce the result depending on a search term and a geolocation Point with a free chosen distance.

### Working with the PHP MongoDB Client

Adapt the Example CRUD to work with a collection `countries`. Use the Class `Countries` as a starting point and add routes to `/public/index.php`.
See [MongoDB PHP Tutorials](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/) for details.
Use `db.users.drop();`, `db.countries.drop();` or `db.orders.drop();` to delete collections  from the commandline during testing.

1. test connection uncommenting the section in `Countries::__construct`
2. create test entries in MongoDB with `/src/Examples/TestData/country.js`.
3. Read inline `//TODO`s to finish exercise

### Working with the doctrine Framework to access MongoDB from PHP

1. *Make yourself familiar with Doctrine*

Look at the TODOs in /src/MongoDoctrine and finish fillUsersArray(), deleteUser() and updateUser().

2. *Finish a more complex example*

Adapt the Example Doctrine to work with a collection `orders`. Use the Class `MyCart` as a starting point and add routes to `/public/index.php`.
See 
- [Doctrine MongoDB ODM Tutorials](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/2.3/index.html) for details.
- [Basic Mapping](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/2.3/reference/basic-mapping.html#basic-mapping)
- [Embed Many](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/2.3/reference/embedded-mapping.html#embed-many)
- [Query Builder API](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/2.3/reference/query-builder-api.html#query-builder-api)
- [Floating Point Guide](https://floating-point-gui.de/languages/php/)
- For Subdocuments see [ArrayCollection](https://phpdox.net/demo/Symfony2/classes/Doctrine_Common_Collections_ArrayCollection.xhtml)
- Use docker in commandline (Powershell or other terminal) to get access to MongoDB. See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-mongo-dock/blob/main/INSTALL.md#docker) for that.
- Use `db.users.drop();`, `db.countries.drop();` or `db.orders.drop();` to delete collections using the commandline during testing.
- Use `db.order.find().pretty();` to see if operations worked.
- use input type "text" to test invalid quantity input using a letter. It's set to number, to enhance user experience.

1. test connection uncommenting the section in `MyCart::__construct`
2. create test entries in MongoDB with `/src/Examples/TestData/cart.js`.
3. Read inline `//TODO`s to finish exercise
